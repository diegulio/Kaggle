# Kaggle

In this repo you will find my solution to the Kaggleâ€™s competitions that I have participated in. My goal is start to compete in more and more competitions, increasing the complexity of them. Here is a list of the competitions:

1. ****Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets****

This is the first competition (It is a Getting started competition). With this I learned about Sequence modeling, NLP and Transformers (In Tensorflow and Hugging Face). In the competition folder you will find a series of notebooks where I apply those concepts. I encourage you to start with : [`seqclass-nn-embed-rnn-lstm-gru-bert-hf.ipynb`](https://github.com/diegulio/Kaggle/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Disaster%20Tweets/seqclass-nn-embed-rnn-lstm-gru-bert-hf.ipynb) notebook
